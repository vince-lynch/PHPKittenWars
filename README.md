# PHP Kitten Wars
### A Simple PHP recreation of the Original Kitten Wars Website, using Scraped Data from KittenWars.com

I was going through the PHP Material at work, and as its been a few years since I've worked on any PHP I thought I would jog my memory in my hometime
I thought a cool way to do this was to make ode to one of the original websites on the internet - Kitten Wars.

I thought an even cooler way would be to actually use KittenWars data through scraping in PHP alone and then organising it in a MySQL database.

I have deployed the site to heroku https://mysterious-river-14065.herokuapp.com/

Various Crud, and PHP Design patterns were used for the layout and file structure, abiding to an MVC (Model-View-Controller structure)

I thought this would be useful, as in my current job as a Frontend Web Developer I mainly deal in CSS, HTML & JavaScript with a PHP backend, I thought it would be useful to make an app using the traditional structure I would use in Node.JS or a Ruby project.
